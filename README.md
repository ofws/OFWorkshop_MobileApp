openFrameworks is a cross-platform tool which means it not only can build apps for our laptop, but also can build mobile apps for our phone and tablet. In this workshop, we will learn how to use OF to build our first mobile app on iOS. 

In workshop, we will walk through all basic knowledge about building iOS apps with OF, such as setting up iOS development environment,  using multi-touch, coding first iOS game and exploring openFrameworks iOS addons.

We are looking for all OF enthusiasts to join us. We will continually run OF workshop every couple weeks. If you want to learn anything else about OF, you can let us know, we will put that into our schedule.
